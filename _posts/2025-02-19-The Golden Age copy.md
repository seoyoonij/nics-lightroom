### **How [Golden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age) was it?**

*During its peak, Mali was the [largest empire](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/mansa-musa-musa-i-mali/) in West Africa and the [richest Empire on Earth in the 14th century](https://theafricanhistory.com/2967)*

Undoubtedly, for the Mali people—especially its ruling class—the empire was a golden era:

- **[Imperial Army](https://www.worldhistory.org/Mali_Empire/)**: Unification of the region, control of [trade routes](https://www.britannica.com/topic/trans-Saharan-trade), and territorial expansion  
    (c.f. For fun: ['Could Mansa Musa and Mali defeat any 14th century European army'](https://historum.com/t/could-mansa-musa-and-mali-defeat-any-14th-century-european-army.100010/page-2))

- **Wealth**: Abundance of [gold dust](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mali/hd_mali.htm), vast [salt deposits](https://www.worldhistory.org/Timbuktu/), and "[the golden ruler](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thecollector.com%2Fmansa-musa-mali-empire-ruler%2F&psig=AOvVaw0aYiu3e-lgSUd93KwGeRlL&ust=1740055575932000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBcQjhxqFwoTCMjbsaXiz4sDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAd)" Mansa Musa's pilgrimage to Mecca 

*"Musa went to the Holy Land with a caravan of tens of thousands of soldiers, slaves, and heralds. They were all dressed in expensive Persian silk and carried golden staffs. It included camels and horses carrying hundreds of pounds of gold. When he went through Egypt, he had an effect on the people that would last for more than a decade.*

*News of Musa’s wealth spread to all parts of the world, not just in Africa. By the end of the 14th century, Musa was shown on the [Catalan Atlas](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCatalan_Atlas&psig=AOvVaw3RWcCWODnfdP0sgpHqIj3R&ust=1740052241628000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBcQjhxqFwoTCKi5xu_Vz4sDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) of 1375, which was an important tool for sailors in medieval Europe. In it, Musa was shown sitting on a golden throne with a golden sceptre, crown, and gold nugget in his hand.([read more](https://theafricanhistory.com/2967))"*

- **Hub for the Islamic faith**: The spread of Islam in West Africa was linked to trade

*"Islamic learning centers, schools, and universities, and the grandest library in all of Africa were a direct result of Mansa Musa's rule and made Mali into a multilingual and multiethnic kingdom."([read more](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/mali-empire/))*

*"The 13th to 17th centuries saw Islam grow fast, thanks to the Mali Empire. Mansa Musa, Mali’s famous ruler, brought scholars from Mecca and built the Great Mosque of Timbuktu. Merchant-scholars were vital in spreading Islam in West Africa. They traded goods and shared Islamic teachings with local communities. Their efforts helped Islamic traditions become part of West African societies, leading to Islamization over time."

- Europe was in its High Middle Ages with the rise of powerful monarchies and intellectual revival
- Yuan Dynasty in China was making significant trade and technological advancements

### **Important contributions of the Mali Empire, commonly spoken of**
Mali made contributions to wealth and knowledge, but did not directly lead to the structure of modern financial or educational systems. 

- The legacy of Timbuktu on global scholarship
  - The "intellectual hub": preserved Islamic and African knowledge
  - but knowledge transmission was largely confined to the region

- The wealth of Mansa Musa
  - His extravagant spending in Cairo fed Mediterranean markets and vast gold reserves
  - but the economic influence was more transactional than systemic: Without paper money, credit systems, or centralized financial institutions (c.f. Italian city states, Islamic financials), it is hard to trace back revolutions in banking, trading, monetary policy in a way that endured through history

- The shadows of prosperity: The empire's reliance on a social structure such as slavery
