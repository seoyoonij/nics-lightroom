A list of bag and desk support tools.

Inspired by [https://ma.tt/category/in-my-bag/]


THE BAG
1. Jansport backpack. A trusty go-to that's been with me for around 8 years. Not the most secure, but a good all-throw-in type of bag. Goes with Maram's small Nepali fish.

DEVICES
2. 13'' Macbook Air. Running on Intel i5 and 16GB RAM, the hand-me-down 2018 laptop is still going strong with most tasks to this day.

3. iPad Pro, which I use as a digital notebook and sometimes for watching workout videos and reading on Kindle.

4. iPhone 12 mini. Small phones are great to fit in backpockets. On the back is my sticky cardholder for Id, key card, FAB card, coupon, etc.

5. Airpods Pro 2nd gen (zombie). The last one in my apple farm. It has been through many drops, rips, and disfunctions. I just somehow get it working again. 

6. TI-84 Calculator. I rarely use it thesedays, but having it in the bag gives a baseline of comfort.

SURVIVAL
7. Thermos cup is for cold water, hot water, and most importantly, tea (Thanks, Matt).

8. Emirates blanket. In my defense, my desk is very cold. This is a nice rectangular blanket of good ratio to have around the shoulders. 

9. Bioderma Atoderm Creme Ultra. Always have a moisturizer at hand for the hands and arms.

10. Tabocine Doxycycline hyclate. Malaria pills I take every 6pm after the Jterm to Uganda. After Feb 11, I am free from the schedule. 

11. Systane Ultra Eyedrops. Lifesaving water for the eyes!

12. Thermal cup from the ARC. Again, good for tea, lime water, etc.

13. Glossier wild fig lipbalm. Small joys of carrying around gifts and using them.

MISCELLAENOUS ESSENTIALS

14. Wallet. Mostly cards but some cash dirhams I recently transacted with Wen. Even then, semi-essential because I rarely use cash and my essential cards are on the back of my phone. 

15. Journal. Carrying it around brings me a sense of mindfulness. I can also jot down thoughts throughout the day as it emerges.

16. Pentel Graphgear 500 mechanical pencil. A trusty tool which I randomly got handed-down from a friend somehow.

17. Mintia is some mint from Japan.

18. Earphones from Korean Air, paired with Lightning adapter. It's always a good idea to have some oldschool backup audio.

19. (Reused) Paper bag. Good for carrying stuff like

20. Multiple yogurts. (and apples as well, to spend the swipes.)

ETC

21. Panadol Advance

22. Another hand cream.

23. Some adaptors and cables I don't quite use but could be helpful one day.

24. Yakgwa for sharing. They're nice Korean traditional sweets.

25. Screwdriver toolbox. Got it from dad, and now Levan and Andre has grown fond of it recently.

26. STM32 and debugger that lies on my desk for reference.

27. STM32F411 Blackpill. Another one of my centipedes.

28. Teabags! Again for the idea of carrying them, rarely for usage. (It's actually been kept for a while.)

29. Ugandan souvenir to give to a friend whom I encounter whenever I don't have it at the moment.

30. Another Ugandan souvenir yet to deliver.

31. La Chinata lipbalm from my friend. It smells cozy.

32. Pens.


c.f. 32 items in total, if I still haven't figured out the numbering properly by presentation.
