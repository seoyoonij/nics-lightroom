### **["Ten Principles for Good Design"](https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design#ten-principles-for-good-design)**: System thinking
  <img src="images/5-2ten.jpg" alt="Image 1" width="800">


  - "I always emphasized that [the principles] weren't meant to last forever. They should be updated." -Rams, 2018

  **- Functional vs. Aesthetic minimalism**  

   "Less but better" should not come at the cost of functional clarity:

  <br>



  **- Simple and elegant vs. Boring and basic**  
    Are the principles used as an excuse to make emotionless, oversimplified design?  
    Logos, skylines, colors etc.

  Diether Rams' remarks on Marc Newson's works:   
  "Experiments like this. It leads to misunderstandings and suddenly we hear, 'Design just means expensive'. Things like this are what lead to that."
