"Architecture is a pragmatic art.   
To become art it must be built on a foundation of necessity."

### **Designing in context, building with challenges**
- [Form follows intention](https://www.whereisthenorth.com/article/im-pei-famous-works-and-philosophies): "When you are building in the middle of history, you have to take history into account. You don't just go ahead and dance around." -I.M. Pei
- Respect to the culture: Buildings are not just for today, they are also for the future. 
- Not much "signature" style from the buildings
- "There's no such thing as modern architecture, postmodern, deconstructivist... You can use all the ism you want. I don't believe in any of them. They come and they go. And the one that really survived, lasting, is architecture. Architecture of that time."

 - "Some were brilliantly executed and adored by the public while others were actually considered huge failures."

      - JFK Presidential Library: Chosen by the Kennedy Family as "he didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem," she said.

  - And his most famous design: The Louvre Pyramid
    [<img src="images/6-6glass.jpg" alt="Image 1" width="800">](https://www.architectureanddesign.com.au/editorial/features/louvre-pyramid-im-pei)
    - "The anger was directed towards the fact that it was a non-french architect chosen for such a historically French site"
    - other criticisms:
      - the modernist style inconsistent with the classic French Renaissance style and history of the Louvre
      - unsuitable symbol of death from ancient Egypt
      - Chinese-American architect being insufficiently familiar with the culture of France to be entrusted with updating the treasured landmark [(read more)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre_Pyramid)
    - Placed a full-sized cable model of the pyramid in the courtyard as a public exhibition for 4 days
    [<img src="images/6-7louvre.jpg" alt="Image 1" width="800">](https://www.architectureanddesign.com.au/editorial/features/louvre-pyramid-im-pei)
    - The Louvre opened for public in 1988, ["an architectural feat that has come to symbolise the museum itself"](https://www.louvre.fr/en/explore/the-palace/a-pyramid-for-a-symbol)
<br>


- Rather than putting him upfront, Pei "built what the place needed, what the time needed. A rational architect suppressing his ego and prioritizing  the client's needs.  (...) What he had was a signature personality, not a signature style." - Michael Cannel, I.M.Pei biographer [(watch here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4mD1bHl_VY) 



"I can imagine only 60% of the space in this building.  
The rest will be as surprising to me as to anyone else."
-Ieoh Ming Pei
